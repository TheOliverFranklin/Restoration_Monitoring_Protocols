**Monitoring Packages Overview**

These packages contain step-by-step guidance to collect, process, and analyse data with the intention of monitoring and assessing the success of your fish habitat restoration actions. The packages are intended for restoration of Pacific salmon habitat, but many of the habitat components assessed also have value far beyond the perspectives of salmon.

The data collection guidance focuses on collecting quantitative data in a repeatable manner, typically with low-cost techniques. The analysis scripts are focused on understanding whether your restoration actions are associated with the intended change in the habitat (implying cause and effect), which you will interpret based on your predicted outcomes and restoration objectives. We assume a before-after-control-impact (BACI) format so that spatial and temporal variation can be controlled, but even if you do not / cannot use this approach, our analysis scripts can still deliver summary metrics and useful figures for your project.

We hope that these monitoring packages reduce the time and cost of monitoring restoration projects, and generate useful insights for your adaptive management.

**This Monitoring Package**

This folder contains the Cross-Sectional Transect Package. The files, in the order that you will need them, are as follows:

- txt: this readme :)

- 2 pdf files: The pdfs contain step-by-step field guidance to collect data, along with some background and rationale. We have produced two versions of cross-sectional transect field methods, depending on whether floodplain reconnection or channel incision is a central aspect of your project. If it is not, the simpler 'channel only' methods can be used (which can save time particularly where floodplains are densely vegetated). Our field method pdfs include a one-page field reference sheet and the field datasheet. 

- xlsx: A field datasheet, which can be used with either version of the cross-sectional protocol (you may not need to use these files, it is probably easier to print them from the pdf above)

- csv: TBC: We intend to upload data entry file templates after the summer field season

- html file: We intend to upload this file after the summer field season. It will contain step by step guidance for data analysis. 

- rmd file:  We intend to upload this file after the summer field season. Corresponding to the above html files, it will contain the R code and guidance.

We are in the process of producing more Monitoring Packages that you can choose from, in a modular fashion, to best track and evaluate the success of your restoration objectives. If you find this package useful, please share it with others. Please get in touch with the authors (oliver.franklin@dfo-mpo.gc.ca and nicci.zargarpour@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) or your local DFO restoration staff if you have requests for additional packages.

The standardised data you collect can be highly valuable beyond your projects. Please share your data to the SHaRe (Salmon Habitat Restoration) System, so that others can conduct research and meta-analyses, to learn from and improve our restoration efforts on a broader scale.

Best of luck in your restoration efforts.
