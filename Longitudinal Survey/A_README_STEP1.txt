**Monitoring Packages Overview**

These packages contain step-by-step guidance to collect, process, and analyse data with the intention of monitoring and assessing the success of your fish habitat restoration actions. The packages are intended for restoration of Pacific salmon habitat, but many of the habitat components assessed also have value far beyond the perspectives of salmon.

The data collection guidance focuses on collecting quantitative data in a repeatable manner, typically with low-cost techniques. The analysis scripts are focused on understanding whether your restoration actions are associated with the intended change in the habitat (implying cause and effect), which you will interpret based on your predicted outcomes and restoration objectives. We assume a before-after-control-impact (BACI) format so that spatial and temporal variation can be controlled, but even if you do not / cannot use this approach, our analysis scripts can still deliver summary metrics and useful figures for your project.

We hope that these monitoring packages reduce the time and cost of monitoring restoration projects, and generate useful insights for your adaptive management.

**This Monitoring Package**

This folder contains the Longitudinal Profile Monitoring Package. The files, in the order that you will need them, are as follows:

- txt: this readme :)

- pdf: field methods including one-page field reference sheet and field datasheet. Contains a brief intro to our Longitudinal Profile approach

- xlsx: field datasheet in spreadsheet format (you may not need to use this, probably easier to print from the pdf above)

- csv: data entry sheet to prepare data from the field for analysis

- 5 html files: step by step guidance for data analysis. Contains some (partially fabricated) example data

- 5 rmd files: corresponding to each html file, these contain the R code and guidance. To be used alongside the html to analyse the data you collected.

We are in the process of producing more Monitoring Packages that you can choose from, in a modular fashion, to best track and evaluate the success of your restoration objectives. If you find this package useful, please share it with others. Please get in touch with the authors (oliver.franklin@dfo-mpo.gc.ca and nicci.zargarpour@dfo-mpo.gc.ca) or your local DFO restoration staff if you have requests for additional packages.

The standardised data you collect can be highly valuable beyond your projects. Please share your data to the SHaRe (Salmon Habitat Restoration) System, so that others can conduct research and meta-analyses, to learn from and improve our restoration efforts on a broader scale.

Best of luck in your restoration efforts
